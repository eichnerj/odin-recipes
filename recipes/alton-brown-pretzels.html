    <h1>Alton Brown's Homemade Soft Pretzels</h1>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups warm water, 110-115¬∫F, plus 10 cups water for boiling</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter (melted)</li>
        <li>2/3 cup baking soda</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk, beaten with 1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil, for the bowl and pan</li>
        <li>Pretzel salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the 1 1/2 cups warm water, the sugar, and kosher salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle the
            yeast on
            top. Set aside until the mixture foams, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the flour and butter and, using the dough hook attachment, mix on low speed until well combined. Change
            to
            medium speed and knead until the dough is smooth and pulls away from the side of the bowl, 4 to 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the dough from the bowl, clean the bowl, then oil it well. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with
            plastic
            wrap, and set aside in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, 50 to 55 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat oven to 450¬∫F. Line 2 half-sheet pans with parchment paper and lightly brush with oil, about 1
            tablespoon per
            pan. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Bring the remaining 10 cups water and the baking soda to a rolling boil in a Dutch oven.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, turn the dough out onto a lightly oiled work surface and divide into 8 equal pieces. Roll out
            each piece
            of dough into a 24-inch rope. Make a U-shape with the rope, and, holding the ends of the rope, cross them
            over each
            other and press onto the bottom of the U in order to form the shape of a pretzel. Place on a half-sheet pan.
            Repeat
            with the remaining pieces of dough.</li>
        <li>One by one, place the pretzels in the boiling water for 30 seconds. Remove them from the water using a large
            flat
            spatula. Return them to the sheet pans, brush the top of each pretzel with the beaten egg yolk and water
            mixture,
            and sprinkle with pretzel salt.</li>
        <li>Bake until dark golden brown in color, 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack for at least 5 minutes
            before
            serving.</li>
    </ol>
